# Unit-2B-Data-Representation2
You have to implement the 5 functions in the Python template code
Each task is defined in the comments
For each task you have to change the return value of the function from 0xABAD1DEA to the return value you want of the correct return type

The tasks are split into two areas:

ASCII: checking and manipulating ASCII charactoers.

The functions isalpha(), isupper() and tolower() check and manipulate ASCII characters.

You may need to use the Python built-in functions ord() and chr() to convert from ASCII
characters to decimail and from decimal back to ASCII.

HEX to Binary: Converting hexadecimal digits to binary

hexdigittobin(): convert a hexadecimal digit (0-9A-F) into a binary string
hextobin(): convert a hexadecimal number to binary - you can use hexdigittobin() and string concatenation to acheive this.You have to implement the 6 functions in the Python template code

When you run the code, it will automatically run the marking engine to give you a score

The marking engine will call your funtions with a set to test data to check that the function works.

Good luck
